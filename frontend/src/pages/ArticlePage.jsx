          <p>
            Bone age is a reading of <strong>skeletal maturity</strong> —
            how far a child's bones have developed — rather than how long
            they have been alive. It's assessed from a single X-ray of the
            left hand and wrist, because the growing ends of those small
            bones (the growth plates) change shape in a predictable order
            from infancy through the end of growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            A radiologist compares that X-ray against a reference and
            reports an age. If a 9-year-old's bones look like the reference
            for an 11-year-old, their bone age is "advanced" by about two
            years. If they look like a 7-year-old's, it's "delayed".

            <p>Two methods dominate clinical practice:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Greulich–Pyle (GP)</strong> — the reader matches the
                whole hand against an atlas of reference radiographs and
                picks the closest match. It's fast and simple, which is why
                it's the most widely used method.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Tanner–Whitehouse (TW3)</strong> — each individual
                bone is scored separately and the scores are summed. It
                takes longer but is more granular.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Bone age is not a routine test. It's requested when a specific
              question needs answering:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Predicting adult height.</strong> Bone age tells you
                how much growing time is left. Two children the same height
                at the same age can have very different adult heights if one
                has far more growth remaining.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Investigating early or late puberty.</strong> Sex
                hormones accelerate skeletal maturation, so a bone age
                running ahead of chronological age is one of the signals
                that supports a precocious puberty workup.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Investigating short stature or poor growth.</strong>{" "}
                A delayed bone age in a short child often means growth is
                simply happening on a later schedule, with more time in hand
                than the current height suggests.
              </li>

            <li>
              <strong>It is not a diagnosis.</strong> Bone age is one input
              among several — growth velocity, parental heights, pubertal
              stage, and blood work all matter.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Readings vary between readers.</strong> Agreement
              between two radiologists reading the same film is good but not
              perfect, so small differences of a few months are not
              meaningful.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>The reference population matters.</strong> The GP
              atlas is built on radiographs of North American children
              collected in the 1930s and 40s. Applying it to contemporary
              children from different populations can introduce bias, which
              is a known limitation and an active area of research.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Height predictions are estimates.</strong> They carry
              a real margin of error and become more reliable closer to the
              end of growth.

              If a bone age has been ordered, it is answering a question
              your doctor already has — it is not a screening test to seek
              out on your own. Bring the report to the appointment along
              with your child's height history; the trend over time is
              usually more informative than any single number.

            More than half of adult bone mass is laid down during
            adolescence. The skeleton a child builds in these years is
            roughly the skeleton they keep — bone that isn't built now is
            very difficult to add later. At the same time, appetite and
            growth rate rise sharply, and food choices start moving out of a
            parent's direct control.

              <strong>Calcium.</strong> Milk, yoghurt and cheese are the
              densest sources. If dairy isn't part of your family's diet,
              small fish eaten with the bones, firm tofu set with calcium,
              fortified soy milk, and dark leafy greens such as kale, pak

              <strong>Vitamin D.</strong> Few foods contain much. Oily fish,

            cm a year. Puberty interrupts that with a burst of rapid growth
            lasting about two to three years. The fastest point in that burst
            is called <strong>peak height velocity (PHV)</strong>, and it is
            the quickest a person will ever grow after infancy.
